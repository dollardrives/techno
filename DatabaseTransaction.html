        		<h1>DataBase Transactions</h1>
				<p>A database transaction is a unit of work that accesses and changes the database’s content. A transaction succeeds as long as all the relevant operations succeed. The transactions can read or write operations.</p>
    		<p>For the database to remain consistent, the transaction must have certain properties usually referred to as ACID. ACID is an acronym for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.</p>
        <p>ACID is particularly concerned with how database management systems recover from any failure than might arise while executing a transaction. All ACID-compliant database management systems ensure the data in the systems remain consistent and accurate regardless of such failures.</p>
        <p>Let’s have a look at these transaction characteristics one by one.</p>
<h3>Atomicity</h3>
Atomicity is also referred to as all-or-nothing property. It guarantees that the whole transaction is successful and not just a part of it. If any part of the transaction fails, the whole transaction fails. So, with this property, we can say it is either all or nothing.

This is achievable by dividing a transaction into smaller sub-transactions which must all the succeed for the transaction to come to completion. Otherwise, the whole process would roll back, or get restored to the original state.

<h3>Consistency<h3>
Consistency is an attribute that ensures all data is always valid regarding all defined rules plus all the triggers, cascades, and constraints relevant to the database. Consistency ensures the enforcement of all constraints on all transactions. It ensures that all Checks, Data Types, and Keys are successful and that there’s no violation of any constraint.

This ensures that you guarantee that all data will be consistent. All data will be valid according to all defined rules, including any constraints, cascades, and triggers relevant to the database.

For example, if a transaction involves transferring some funds from account A to account B, consistency ensures the total cash in both accounts remains the same at the end of the transaction.

<h3>Isolation</h3>
Isolation guarantees that all SQL transactions occur in isolation.

But what is <a href="https://www.tracedynamics.com/what-is-sql-transaction/" target="_blank">SQL transaction?</a>

This is the propagation of changes to a database.

In essence, isolation ensures all transactions act independently without interference from other transactions. For example, one transaction can not read data from an incomplete transaction.
